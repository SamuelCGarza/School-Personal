Python’s pow function returns the result of raising a number to a given power.

Define a function expo() that performs this task. The first argument of this function is the base number, and the second argument is the exponent (nonnegative numbers only). You can use either a loop or a recursive function in your implementation, but do not use Python’s ** operator or pow function.
State its computational complexity using big-O notation in the docstring.
To test your program run the main() method in the expo.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

0 1
1 2
2 4
3 8
4 16
