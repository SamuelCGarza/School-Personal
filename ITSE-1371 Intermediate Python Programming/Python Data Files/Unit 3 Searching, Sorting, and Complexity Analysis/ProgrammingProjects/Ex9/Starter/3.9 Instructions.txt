Implement the insertionSort function and modify the quicksortHelper() function so that it calls insertion sort to sort any sublist whose size is less than 50 items.

Compare the performance of this version with that of the original one, using data sets of 50, 500, and 5000 items.

Afterwards, adjust the threshold for using the insertion sort to determine an optimal setting based on your findings from the step above.

To test your program run the main() method in the testquicksort.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

[21, 16, 13, 17, 18, 14, 20, 18, 7, 10, 6, 4, 12, 17, 12, 1, 3, 4, 15, 19]
[1, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 17, 18, 18, 19, 20, 21]
