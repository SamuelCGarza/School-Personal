An alternative strategy for the expo() function uses the following recursive definition:

expo(base, exponent)
= 1, when exponent = 0
= base * expo(base, exponent - 1), when exponent is odd
= (expo(base, exponent / 2))2, when exponent is even
Define a recursive function expo() that uses this strategy.

To test your program run the main() method in the expo.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

0 1
1 2
2 4
3 8
4 16
