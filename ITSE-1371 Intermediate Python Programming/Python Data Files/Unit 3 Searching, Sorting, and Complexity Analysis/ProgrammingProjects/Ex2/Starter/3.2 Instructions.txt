The List method reverse() reverses the elements in the list.

In the reverse.py file, complete the following:

Define a function named reverse() that reverses the elements in its list argument. Do not use the List method .reverse().
Try to make the function as efficient as possible.
State its computational complexity using big-O notation in the docString/headerDoc.
To test your program run the main() method in the reverse.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

[3, 2, 1, 0]
[2, 1, 0]
