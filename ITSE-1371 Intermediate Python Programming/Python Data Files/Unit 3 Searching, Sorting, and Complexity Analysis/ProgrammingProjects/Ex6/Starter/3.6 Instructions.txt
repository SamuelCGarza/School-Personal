The Fibonacci sequence is, by definition, the integer sequence in which every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

In the fib.py file, complete the following:

Modify the recursive Fibonacci function to employ the memoization technique discussed in this chapter.
Form a base case for any number in the sequence, except for the first and second, is the sum of the previous two
A base case in a recursive function tells the function when to stop (to avoid going into an infinite loop)

The function should expect a dictionary as an additional argument. The top-level call of the function receives an empty dictionary.
The functionâ€™s keys and values should be the arguments and values of the recursive calls.
Use the counter object discussed in this chapter to count the number of recursive calls.
Counter is already provided in the main() method

To test your program run the main() method in the fib.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

   n         fib
   2           1
   4           3
   8          21
  16         987
