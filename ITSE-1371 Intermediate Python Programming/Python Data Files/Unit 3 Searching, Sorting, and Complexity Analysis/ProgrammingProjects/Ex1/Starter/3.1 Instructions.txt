A sequential search of a sorted list can halt when the target is less than a given element in the list. Define a modified version of this algorithm. In the docString/headerDoc above the linearSearch() function, state the computational complexity, using big-O notation, of:

Its best-case performance
Its worst-case performance
Its average-case performance
The linearSearch() function should return the position of the target, if the item is not found it should return -1.

To test your program run the main() method in the search.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

0
-1
-1
