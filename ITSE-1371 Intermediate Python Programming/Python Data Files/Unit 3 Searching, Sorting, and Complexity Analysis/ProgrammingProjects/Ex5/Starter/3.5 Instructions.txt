Pythonâ€™s list method sort() includes the keyword argument reverse, whose default value is False. The programmer can override this value to sort a list in descending order.

Modify the selectionSort() function discussed in this chapter so that it allows the programmer to supply this additional argument to redirect the sort.

To test your program run the main() method in the sort.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
