The clone() method expects no arguments when called, and returns an exact copy of the type of bag on which it is called.

Be sure to reuse your solution from Programming Exercise 5.4 as your starter file for the arraybag.py file.

In the arraybag.py file complete the following:

Define the clone() method to the ArrayBag class.
Returns a copy of self.
In the linkedbag.py file complete the following:

Define the clone() method to the LinkedBag class.
Returns a copy of self.

For example, the variable bag2 would contain the numbers 2, 3 and 4 at the end of the following code segment:

bag1 = ArrayBag([2,3,4])
bag2 = bag1.clone()
bag1 == bag2 # Returns True
bag1 is bag2 # Returns False
