The add() method resizes the array properly when items are added to the array.

In the arraybag.py file define the add() method in the ArrayBag class by completing the following:

Check array memory and increase it if necessary
To test your program run the test() method in the testbag.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Testing <class 'arraybag.ArrayBag'>
The list of items added is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Expect the bag's string: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Add 5 more items to test increasing the array size:
Expect the bag's string: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
