When you send a file to be printed on a shared printer, it is put onto a print queue with other jobs. Anytime before your job prints, you can access the queue to remove it. Thus, some queues support a remove operation.

The remove() method should expect an item as an argument. It should remove the given item in the queue or raise an exception if the item is not found.

In the arrayqueue.py file, complete the following:

Define the remove() method to the ArrayQueue class implementation.
In the linkedqueue.py file, complete the following:

Define the remove() method to the LinkedQueue class implementation.
To test your program run the test() method in the testqueue.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Length: 0
Empty: True
Add 1-10
Peeking: 1
Items (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Length: 10
Empty: False
Items in clone (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Length of clone after clear: 0
Pop 3 items: 1 2 3 
Queue:  [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Adding 11 and 12:
Queue:  [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
Popping items (front to rear): 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 
Length: 0
Empty: True
Create with 11 items:
Items (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
Items (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Popping two items:  1 2 [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Adding five items: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Removing 6: [3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
