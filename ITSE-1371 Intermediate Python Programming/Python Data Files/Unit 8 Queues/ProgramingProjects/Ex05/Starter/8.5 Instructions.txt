In real life, customers do not choose a random cashier when they check out. They typically base their choice on at least the following two factors:

The length of a line of customers waiting to check out.
The physical proximity of a cashier.
Modify the simulation of Exercise 4 so that it takes account of the first factor.

In the Cashier class of the cashier.py file, complete the following:

Define the getLineLength() method:
Returns the number of customers in the line.
In the MarketModel class of the marketmodel.py file, complete the following:

Define the pickCashier() method:
Returns the cashier for the next customer, based on the shortest line of customers.
To test your program run the main() method in the marketapp.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Welcome to the Market Simulator!

Enter the total running time: 30
Enter the average processing time per customer: 3
Enter the probability of a new arrival: 1
Enter the number of cashiers: 4
