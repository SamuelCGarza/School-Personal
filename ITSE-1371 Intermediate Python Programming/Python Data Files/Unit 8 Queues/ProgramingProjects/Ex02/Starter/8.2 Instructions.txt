Complete and test the circular array implementation of the queue collection discussed in this chapter.

In the arrayqueue.py file, complete the following:

Complete the implementation of the clear() method
Makes self become empty.
Complete the implementation of the add() method
Inserts item at rear of the queue.
Complete the implementation of the pop() method
Removes and returns the item at the front of the queue.
Raise KeyError if queue is empty
Verify that exceptions are raised when preconditions are violated and that the implementation adds or removes storage as needed.

In the linkedqueue.py file, complete the following:

Complete the clear() method
Makes self become empty.
To test your program run the test method in the testqueue.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Length: 0
Empty: True
Add 1-10
Peeking: 1
Items (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Length: 10
Empty: False
Items in clone (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Length of clone after clear: 0
Pop 3 items: 1 2 3 
Queue:  [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Adding 11 and 12:
Queue:  [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
Popping items (front to rear): 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 
Length: 0
Empty: True
Create with 11 items:
Items (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
Items (front to rear): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Popping two items:  1 2 [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Adding five items: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
