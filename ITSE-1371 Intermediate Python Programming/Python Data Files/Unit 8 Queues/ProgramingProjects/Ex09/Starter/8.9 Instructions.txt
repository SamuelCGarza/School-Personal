Modify the maze-solving application of Chapter 7, Exercise 9 so that it uses a queue instead of a stack.

In the LinkedQueue class of the linkedqueue.py file, complete the following:

Complete the implementation of the constructor:
__init__
Complete the implementation of the accessor methods:
__iter__
peek()
Complete the implementation of the mutator methods:
clear()
add()
pop()
Once the queue has been setup in the maze.py file, complete the following:

Import the LinkedQueue and Counter modules from their designated files.
Modify the main() method:
Run each version of the application on the same maze.
Count the total number of choice points required by each version.
LinkedQueue should visit 247 choice points
Can you conclude anything from the differences in these results?

To test your program run the main() method in the maze.py file.
