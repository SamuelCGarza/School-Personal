Modify the simulation of Exercise 5 so that it takes account of both factors:

The length of a line of customers waiting to check out.
The physical proximity of a cashier.
You should assume that a customer initially arrives at the checkout line of a random cashier and then chooses a cashier who is no more than two lines away from this spot. This simulation should have at least four cashiers.

In the MarketModel class of the marketmodel.py file, complete the following:

Return the cashier for the next customer, based on the shortest line of customers no more than two lines away.
Pick a random index and create a sublist of the allowable cashiers
Search the short list for the cashier with the shortest line
To test your program run the main() method in the marketapp.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Welcome to the Market Simulator!

Enter the total running time: 30
Enter the average processing time per customer: 3
Enter the probability of a new arrival: 1
Enter the number of cashiers: 4
