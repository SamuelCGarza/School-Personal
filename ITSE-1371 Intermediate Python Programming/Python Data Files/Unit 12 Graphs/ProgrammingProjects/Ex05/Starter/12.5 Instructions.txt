In the algorithms.py file, complete the following:

Be sure to reuse your solution from Programming Exercise 12.4 as your starter file for the graph.py and algorithms.py files.

Define a function breadthFirst which performs a breadth-first traversal on a graph, given a start vertex.
Returns a list of the vertex labels in the order in which the vertices were visited.
To test your program run the run() method in the GraphDemoView class of the view.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Main menu
  1  Input a graph from the keyboard
  2  Input a graph from a file
  3  View the current graph
  4  Single source shortest paths
  5  Minimum spanning tree
  6  Topological sort
  7  Breadth First Traversal
  8  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-8]: 2
Enter the file name: topo.txt
Graph created successfully
Main menu
  1  Input a graph from the keyboard
  2  Input a graph from a file
  3  View the current graph
  4  Single source shortest paths
  5  Minimum spanning tree
  6  Topological sort
  7  Breadth First Traversal
  8  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-8]: 7
Breadth first order: p s q t r
Main menu
  1  Input a graph from the keyboard
  2  Input a graph from a file
  3  View the current graph
  4  Single source shortest paths
  5  Minimum spanning tree
  6  Topological sort
  7  Breadth First Traversal
  8  Exit the program

Enter a number [1-8]: 8
The test above is inputting the graph from the topo.txt file.
