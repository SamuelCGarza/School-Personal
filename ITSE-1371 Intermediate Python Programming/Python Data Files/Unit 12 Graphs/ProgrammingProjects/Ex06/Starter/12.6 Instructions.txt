In the path.py file complete the following:

Define the function hasPath().
This function expects a directed graph and the labels of two vertices as arguments.
Returns True if there is a path between the two vertices or returns False otherwise.
To test your program run the main() method in the path.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

The graph:
 5 Vertices:  A B C D E
5 Edges:  A>B:3 A>C:2 B>D:1 C>D:1 D>E:2
Path from B to A: False
Path from B to B: False
Path from B to C: False
Path from B to D: True
Path from B to E: True
Path from B to X: False
