Most word processors have a feature called word wrap, which automatically moves the user’s next word down a line when the right margin is reached. To explore how this feature works, write a program in wordwrap.py that allows the user to reformat the text in a file.

In the wordwrap.py file complete the following:

The user should input the line width in characters and input the names of the input and output files.
The program should then input the words from the file into a list of sublists.
Each sublist represents a line of text to be output to the file.
As the words are input into each sublist, the program tracks the length of that line to ensure that it is less than or equal to the user’s line length.
When all the words have been entered into the sublists, the program should traverse them to write their contents to the output file.
To test your program run the main method in the wordwrap.py file.

When testing you will be asked to input values:

Choose any input file from the available starter files
Name your output file
Enter a number greater or equal to 40 for the line width.
