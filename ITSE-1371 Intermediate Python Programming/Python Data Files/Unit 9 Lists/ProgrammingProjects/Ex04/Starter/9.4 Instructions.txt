In the filemodel.py file, write a program that inserts lines of text from a file into a list and allows the user to view and navigate through any line of text from the file.

The program should present a menu of options (provided in fileview.py) that allows the user to enter a filename and to navigate to the first line, the last line, the next line, and the previous line.

In the FileModel class of the filemodel.py file, complete the following:

Complete the implementation of the __init__ method.
Complete the implementation of the first() method.
Allows user to navigate to first line of file.
Complete the implementation of the last() method.
Allows user to navigate to last line of file.
Complete the implementation of the next() method.
Allows user to navigate to next line of file.
Complete the implementation of the previous() method.
Allows user to navigate to previous line of file.
To test your program run the run() method in the fileview.py file.

When testing, choose any filename followed by testing the commands menu. Select a new filename on option 5.
