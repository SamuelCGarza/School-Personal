Define the recursive functions lispMap() and lispFilter() for LISP constructed lists. Their behavior is similar to that of the Python functions map() and filter(), but the LISP functions return a list of the results.

Be sure to reuse your solution from Programming Exercise 9.9 as your starter file for the lisplist.py file.

In the Node class of the lisplist.py file, complete the following:

Complete the implementation of the listMap() function.
Returns the results of applying function to each item in lyst.
Complete the implementation of the lispFilter() function.
Returns the items that pass the Boolean test.
To test your program run the main() method in the lisplist.py file.

Here is a sample interaction with this program:

>>> lyst = buildRange(1, 4)
>>> lyst
(1 2 3 4)
>>> lispMap(lambda x: x ** 2, lyst)
(1 4 9 16)
>>> lispFilter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lyst)
(2 4)
>>> lispFilter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0,
 lispMap(lambda x: x ** 2, lyst))
(4 16)
