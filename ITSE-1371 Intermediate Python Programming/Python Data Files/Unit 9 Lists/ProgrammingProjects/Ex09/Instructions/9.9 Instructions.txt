Define a recursive function removeAll that expects an item and a Lisp-like list as arguments. This function returns a Lisp-like list with all of the instances of the item removed.

In the lisplist.py file, make sure to include the insert() and equal() methods from Programming exercise 9.7 and Programming exercise 9.8.

Hint: Keep on removing the item if it equals the listâ€™s first item.

Here is an example of its use:

>>> lyst = cons(2, cons(2, (cons 3, THE_EMPTY_LIST)))
>>> lyst
(2 2 3)
>>> removeAll(2, lyst)
(3)
>>> removeAll(3, lyst)
(2 2)
