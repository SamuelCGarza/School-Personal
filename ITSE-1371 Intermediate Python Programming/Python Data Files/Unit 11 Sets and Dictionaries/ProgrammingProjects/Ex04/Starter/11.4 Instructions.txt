Modify the Profiler class in the profiler.py file to allow the programmer to study the behavior of the HashTable method get .

Recall that this method must skip over previously occupied cells when probing for a target item.
This profiler should insert a set of data items into the table
Remove a specified number of them
Run get with the remaining items.
Make sure to add the __len__(), __str__(), getLoadFactor(), getHomeIndex(), getActualIndex(), getProbeCount() and get() methods in the HashTable class of the hashtable.py file from exercise 3.

The programmer should be able to view results of the following:

Total numer of collisions.
Total number of probes.
Average number of probes per collision.
Your program's output should look like the following:

Table: [40, None, ..., ..., ..., ..., 30, 70]
Table: [True, None, ..., ..., ..., ..., 30, 70]
Load Factor  Item Accessed  Home Index  Actual Index   Probes
   0.500            10           2           2             0
   0.500            30           6           6             0
   .....            ..           .           .             .
   .....            ..           .           .             .
Total collisions: 2
Total probes: 2
Average probes per collision: 1.0
