Complete the hashing implementation of a hash-based dictionary.

This hashing implementation uses the bucket/chaining strategy quite similar to that of the HashSet class from Exercise 5.

In the hashdict.py file complete the following methods:

__iter__
clear()
pop()
Test the hashing implementation with the main() method located in the testdict.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Length:  5

The dictionary:  {1:Value1, 2:Value2, 3:Value3, 4:Value4, 5:Value5}

The keys: [1, ., ., ., 5]

The values: ['Value1', '......', '......', '......', 'Value5']

The entries: ['1:Value1', '........', '........', '........', '5:Value5']

Key Value (using []): 1 Value1 . ...... . ...... . ...... 5 Value5 
Replace Value1 with ValueZ:  {1:ValueZ, ........, ........, ........, 5:Value5}

Delete all keys:
ValueZ
......
......
......
Value5
