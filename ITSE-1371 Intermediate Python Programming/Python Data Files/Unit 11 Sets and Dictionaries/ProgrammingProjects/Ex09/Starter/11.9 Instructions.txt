Complete a tree-based implementation of a sorted dictionary, treesorteddict.py using a similar strategy to that of exercise 8 in this chapter. However, in this case, the sorted dictionary can inherit some standard collection methods, such as __len__, __str___, and __add__, from its parent class.

Remove the __len__, __add__ and __str__ methods from the TreeSortedDict() class.
Add and inherit the methods from the parent class AbstractDict.
Verify the methods work as expected.
