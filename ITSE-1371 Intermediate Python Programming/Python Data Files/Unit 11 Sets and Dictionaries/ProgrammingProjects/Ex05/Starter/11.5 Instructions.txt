Complete the hashing implementation of a hash-based set.

Thus, the implementation must maintain an array and represent entries in such a manner as to allow chaining.

In the hashset.py file complete the following methods:

__str__
__iter__
remove()

In the AbstractSet class of the abstractset.py file, complete the following:

Complete the implementation of the __eq__ function
Returns True if self equals other, or False otherwise.
Test the hashing implementation with the test() method located in the testset.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Testing <class 'hashset.HashSet'>
The list of items added is: [2013, 61, 1973, 1973]
Length, expect 3: 3
Expect the set's string: {1973, ...., 61}
Expect True: True
Expect False: ....
Expect the items on separate lines:
1973
....
61
Expect {}: {}
Expect {}: {}
Expect True: True
Expect False: False
s1: {...., 2013, ..} s2: {...., 61, ..}
s1 | s2: {1973, ...., .., 44}
s1 & s2: {...., 61}
s1 - s2: {....}
s2 - s1: {44}
Expect {}: {}
