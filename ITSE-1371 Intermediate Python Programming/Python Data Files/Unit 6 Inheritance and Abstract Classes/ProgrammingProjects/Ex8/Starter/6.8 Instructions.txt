Be sure to reuse your solution from Programming Exercise 6.7 as your starter file for the arraysortedbag.py, linkedbag.py, abstractbag.py, arrayset.py, linkedset.py and arraysortedset.py files.

In the ArrayBag class of the arraybag.py file, complete the following:

Complete the implementation of the __contains__ method to perform the customized search.
Eliminate the redundant search by tracking the position of the target item in an instance variable, targetIndex.
In the case of an array-based bag, this position would be –1 at startup and whenever a target item is not found.
If the in operator finds a target item, the position variable is set to that item’s index in the array; otherwise, it is reset to –1.
After the remove() method checks its precondition, no search loop is necessary.
The method can just close the hole in the array using the position variable.

To test your program run the test() method in the testset.py file.
