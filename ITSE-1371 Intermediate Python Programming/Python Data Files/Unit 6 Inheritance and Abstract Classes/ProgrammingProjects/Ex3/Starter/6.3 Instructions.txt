Modify the AbstractBag class so that it behaves as a subclass of AbstractCollection provided in the file abstractcollection.py.

Be sure to reuse your solution from Programming Exercise 6.2 as your starter file for the arraysortedbag.py and linkedbag.py files.

In the AbstractBag class of the abstractbag.py file, complete the following:

Import the AbstractCollection class from the abstractcollection.py file
Modify the __init__ so that it contains the contents of sourceCollection from the AbstractCollection class, if it's present.
Remove any methods that are redundant from the AbstractBag class.
Be sure to retain in the AbstractBag class only those methods that cannot be moved to AbstractCollection.

To test your program run the test() method in the testbag.py file.
