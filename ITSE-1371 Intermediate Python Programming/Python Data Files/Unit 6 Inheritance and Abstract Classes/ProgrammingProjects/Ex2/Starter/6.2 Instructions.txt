Modify the LinkedBag class discussed in Chapter 5, Exercise 7 (provided in linkedbag.py), so that it becomes a subclass of AbstractBag.

Be sure to reuse your solution from Programming Exercise 6.1 as your starter file for the arraysortedbag.py file.

In the LinkedBag class of the linkedbag.py file, complete the following:

Import the AbstractBag class from the abstractbag.py file
Modify the __init__ so that it contains the contents of sourceCollection from the AbstractBag class, if it's present.
Remove any methods that are redundant from the LinkedBag class.
Be sure to retain in the LinkedBag class only those methods that cannot be moved to AbstractBag.

To test your program run the test() method in the testbag.py file.
