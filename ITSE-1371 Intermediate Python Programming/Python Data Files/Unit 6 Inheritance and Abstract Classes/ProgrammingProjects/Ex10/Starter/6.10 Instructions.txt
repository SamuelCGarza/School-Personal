The remove() method in the LinkedBag class has the redundant search described in Programming Exercise 6.8 of this chapter.

Be sure to reuse your solution from Programming Exercise 6.9 as your starter file for the arraysortedbag.py, linkedbag.py, abstractbag.py, arrayset.py, linkedset.py, arraysortedset.py, and arraybag.py files.

In the linkedbag.py file complete the following:

Modify the following methods in the LinkedBag class so that redundancy no longer exists:
__init__
__contains__
clear()
remove()
To test your program run the test() method in the testset.py file.
