The modified remove() method of Programming Exercise 6.8 no longer works correctly for a sorted bag. The reason for this is that the __contains__ method in ArraySortedBag class does not update the new position variable in ArrayBag.

Be sure to reuse your solution from Programming Exercise 6.8 as your starter file for the arraysortedbag.py, linkedbag.py, abstractbag.py, arrayset.py, linkedset.py, arraysortedset.py, and arraybag files.

In the ArraySortedBag class of the arraysortedbag.py file, complete the following:

Modify the __contains__ method, so that the remove() method works correctly for sorted bags.
To test your program run the test() method in the testset.py file.
