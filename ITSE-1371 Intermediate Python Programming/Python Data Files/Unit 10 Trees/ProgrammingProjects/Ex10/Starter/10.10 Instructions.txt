In the algorithms.py file, complete the following

Implement and test a heapSort function that is based on the heap class developed in this chapter.
Profile this function using the technology developed in Chapter 3, “Searching, Sorting, and Complexity Analysis,” to verify its run-time complexity.
To test your program run the main() method in the test.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Problem size: 100
Elapsed time: 0.002
Comparisons:  710
Exchanges:    522

Problem size: 1000
Elapsed time: 0.043
