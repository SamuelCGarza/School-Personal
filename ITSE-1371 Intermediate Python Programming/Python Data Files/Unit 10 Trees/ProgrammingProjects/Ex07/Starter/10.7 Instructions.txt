In the expressiontree.py file, complete the implementation of the node classes, LeafNode and InteriorNode for the expression tree developed in this chapter.

The LeafNode class, represents an integer and the InteriorNode class represents an operator and its two operands.

In the LeafNode class of the expressiontree.py file, complete the following:

Define the __init__ method.
Define the value() method.
Define the __str__ method.
Define the infix() method.
Define the prefix() method.
Define the postfix() method.
In the InteriorNode class of the expressiontree.py file, complete the following:

Define the __init__ method.
Define the value() method.
Calculates and returns the correct value of the node.
Define the __str__ method.
Make sure the values below are returned in the proper order.

Define the infix() method.
Define the prefix() method.
Define the postfix() method.
Define the computeValue() method.
Utility routine to compute a value.
To test your program run the main() method in the expressiontree.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Expect ((4 * (2 + 3) - (2 + 3)): ((4 * (2 + 3)) - (2 + 3))
Expect - * 4 + 2 3 + 2 3       : - * 4 + 2 3 + 2 3
Expect 4 2 3 + * 2 3 + -       : 4 2 3 + * 2 3 + -
Expect 15                      : 15
