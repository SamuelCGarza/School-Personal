Test for exponentiation to the expression tree developed in Exercise 7 of this chapter to make sure InteriorNode handles the ^ operator and raises the values to the power of the provided parameters.

Be sure to reuse your solution from Programming Exercise 10.7 as your starter file for the expressiontree.py file.

In the tokens.py file, complete the following:

Add the ^ power operator to the available tokens, set it to 9 and name it as EXPO.
Modify the _makeType method to handle the ^ operator with the EXPO token.
Add a variable named expo to the main() method and print the exponentiation token to the tester program.
In the InteriorNode class of the expressiontree.py file, complete the following:

Modify the computeValue() method so that it handles the EXPO token.
Raises the values to the power of the provided parameters of value1 and value2.
To test your program run the main() method in the expressiontree.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Expect ((4 * (2 + 3) ^ (2 + 3)): ((4 * (2 + 3)) ^ (2 + 3))
Expect ^ * 4 + 2 3 + 2 3       : ^ * 4 + 2 3 + 2 3
Expect 4 2 3 + * 2 3 + ^       : 4 2 3 + * 2 3 + ^
Expect 3200000                 : 3200000
