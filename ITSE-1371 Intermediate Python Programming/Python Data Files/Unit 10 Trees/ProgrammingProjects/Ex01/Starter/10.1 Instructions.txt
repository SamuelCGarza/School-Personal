Complete the implementation of the LinkedBST class, in the linkedbst.py file, discussed in this chapter.

In the LinkedBST class of the linkedbst.py file, complete the following:

Complete the implementation of the preorder() method.
Supports a preorder traversal on a view of self.
Complete the implementation of the inorder() method.
Supports an inorder traversal on a view of self.
Complete the implementation of the postorder() method.
Supports a postorder traversal on a view of self.
Complete the implementation of the levelorder() method.
Supports a levelorder traversal on a view of self.
To test your program run the main() method in the testbst.py file. You can reference this file to verify the requirements of the LinkedBST class.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Output may vary because the last list is generated randomly

Adding D B A C F E G

Expect True for A in tree:  True

String:
| | G
| F
| | E
D
| | C
| B
| | A


Clone:
| | G
| F
| | E
D
| | C
| B
| | A

Expect True for tree == clone:  True

For loop: D B A C F E G 

inorder traversal: A B C D E F G 

preorder traversal: D B A C F E G 

postorder traversal: A C B E G F D 

levelorder traversal: D B F A C E G 

Removing all items: A B C D E F G 

Expect 0:  0
