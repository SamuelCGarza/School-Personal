The ArraySortedSet class discussed in Chapter 6, Exercise 7 is an array-based implementation of a sorted set collection. A linked implementation, named TreeSortedSet, uses a binary search tree. Complete and test this new implementation of a sorted set collection.

Be sure to reuse your solution from Programming Exercise 10.5 as your starter file for the linkedbst.py file.

In the TreeSortedSet class of the treesortedset.py file, complete the following:

Complete the implementation of the following methods:
__init__
__iter__
__eq__
clear()
add()
remove()
Compare the run-time performance of the add, remove, and clear operations of the two implementations of sorted sets.

To test your program run the test() method in the testset.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

The list of items added is: [2013, 61, 1973]
Expect 3: 3
Expect the set's string: {61, 1973, 2013}
Expect True: True
Expect False: False
Expect the items on separate lines:
61
1973
2013
Expect {}: {}
Expect {}: {}
Expect True: True
Expect False: False
Expect one of each item: {61, 1973, 2013}
Expect {}: {}
