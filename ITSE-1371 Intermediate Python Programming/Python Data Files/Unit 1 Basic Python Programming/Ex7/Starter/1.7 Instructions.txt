Statisticians would like to have a set of functions to compute the median and mode of a list of numbers.

Define the three functions median, mode, mean in the stats.py file.
The median is the number that would appear at the midpoint of a list if it were sorted.
The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list.
Each function expects a list of numbers as an argument and returns a single number.
Also include a function named mean, which computes the average of a set of numbers. The main() has been provided for you.
Your program's output should look like the following:

Enter a Value for the list: 41
Enter a Value for the list: 42
Enter a Value for the list: 43
Enter a Value for the list: 44
Enter a Value for the list: 45
Enter a Value for the list: 46
List: [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]
Mode: 41
Median: 43.5
Mean: 43.5

The test above was done with the list [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]. Be sure to test with the same list.
