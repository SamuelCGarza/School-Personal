A standard science experiment is to drop a ball and see how high it bounces. Once the bounciness of the ball has been determined, the ratio gives a bounciness index.

For example, if a ball dropped from a height of 10 feet, bounces 6 feet high and the index is 0.6 the total distance traveled by the ball is 16 feet after one bounce.

If the ball were to continue bouncing, the distance after two bounces would be 10 ft + 6 ft + 6 ft + 3.6 ft = 25.6 ft.

Note that the distance traveled for each successive bounce is the distance to the floor plus 0.6 of that distance as the ball comes back up.

Write a program that lets the user input the initial height of the ball as a float, the bounciness index of the ball as a float, and the number of times the ball is allowed to continue bouncing as an int.
Calculate the total distance traveled by the ball using the user inputs
Print the output of the total distance traveled by the ball.
Your program's output should look like the following:

Enter the height from which the ball is dropped: 3
Enter the bounciness index of the ball: 1
Enter the number of times the ball is allowed to continue bouncing: 3

Total distance traveled is: 18.0 units.
