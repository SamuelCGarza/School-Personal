The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period in a text file. The format of each line of the file is:

<last name> <hours worked> <hourly wage>

Write a program that requests a filename from the user and prints a report to the terminal of the wages paid to the employees for the given period.
The report should be in tabular format with the appropriate header.
Each line should contain an employeeâ€™s name, the hours worked, and the wages paid for that period.
Be sure that monetary values have the appropriate number of decimal places, 2.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Enter the file name: data.md 
Name            Hours      Total Pay
Lambert            34         357.00
Osborne            22         137.50
Giacometti          5         503.50


The test above is using the data.md file.
