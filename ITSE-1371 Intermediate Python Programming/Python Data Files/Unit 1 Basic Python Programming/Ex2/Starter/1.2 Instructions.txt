Write a program that takes the radius of a sphere (a floating-point number) as input and outputs the sphere's:

Diameter
Circumference
Surface area
Volume
in that order.

Be sure to import the math module to compute the calculations.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Enter the sphere's radius: 4
Diameter     : 8.0
Circumference: 25.132741228718345
Surface area : 201.06192982974676
Volume       : 268.082573106329
The test above is with the input of 4. Feel free to test with other numbers.
