A simple course management system models a student’s information with a name and a set of test scores. This system should be able to create a student object with a given name and a number of scores, all of which will be 0 at startup.

The system should be able to access or replace a score at the given position (counting from 0):

obtain the number of scores - getNumberOfScores()
obtain the highest score - getHighScore()
obtain the average score - getAverage()
obtain the student’s name - getName()
In addition, the student object when printed should show the student’s name and scores as in the following example:

Name: Ken Lambert 
Score 1: 88 
Score 2: 77 
Score 3: 100 
High score: 100
Average: 88.333

Define a Student class that supports these features and behavior. A main() has been provided for you in order to test the implementation of your Student class.
