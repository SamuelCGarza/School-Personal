This exercise asks you to define some functions for manipulating linked structures. You should use the Node and TwoWayNode classes, as defined in this chapter.

Create a tester module in the testnode.py file that contains your function definitions and your code for testing them.

In the testnode.py file, complete the following:

Complete the implementation of the length() function (not len).
This function expects a singly linked structure as an argument.
Returns the number of items in the structure.
To test your program run the main() method in the testnode.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

0: 0
5: 5
