In the Array class of the arrays.py file complete the following:

Modify the __init__ method to add an instance variable logicalSize.
This variable is initially 0 and will track the number of items currently available to users of the array.
Define the size() method.
This method should return the array’s logical size.
The method __len__should still return the array’s capacity or physical size.
To test your program run the main() method in the arrays.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:
Physical size: 10
Logical size: 0
Items: [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]
