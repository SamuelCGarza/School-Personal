In the Array class of the arrays.py file complete the following:

Add preconditions to the methods __getitem__ and __setitem__.
The precondition of each method is 0 <= index < size().
Be sure to raise an IndexError exception if the precondition is not satisfied.
To test your program run the main() method in the arrays.py file.

Your program's output should look like the following:

Physical size: 10
Logical size: 0
Items: [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".solution/arrays.py", line 69, in <module>
    main()
  File ".solution/arrays.py", line 66, in main
    print(a[0])
  File ".solution/arrays.py", line 45, in __getitem__
    raise IndexError("Array index out of bounds")
IndexError: Array index out of bounds
