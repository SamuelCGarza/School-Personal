In the Array class of the arrays.py file complete the following:

Be sure to reuse your solution from Programming Exercise 4.4 as your starter file for the arrays.py file.

Define the __eq__ method.
Python runs this method when an Array object appears as the left operand of the == operator.
The method returns True if its argument is:
Also an Array,
Has the same logical size as the left operand
The pair of items at each logical position in the two arrays are equal.
Otherwise, the method returns False.
To test your program run the main() method below in the arrays.py file:

def main():
    a = Array(5)
    for item in range(4):
        a.insert(0, item)
    b = a
    c = Array(5)
    for item in range(4):
        c.insert(0, item)
    print("True:", a == b)
    print("True:", a is b)
    print("True:", a == c)
    print("False:", a is c)
    c.insert(10, 10)
    print("False:", a == c)
    c.pop(c.size() - 1)
    c[2] = 6
    print("False:", a == c)
    d = []
    print("False:", a == d)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Your program's output should look like the following:
True: True
True: True
True: True
False: False
False: False
False: False
False: False
