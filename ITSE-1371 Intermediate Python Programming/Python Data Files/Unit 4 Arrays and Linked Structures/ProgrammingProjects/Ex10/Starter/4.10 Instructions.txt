This exercise asks you to define some functions for manipulating linked structures. You should use the Node and TwoWayNode classes, as defined in this chapter.

Be sure to reuse your solution from Programming Exercise 4.9 as your starter file for the testnode.py file.

In the testnode.py file complete the following:

Complete the implementation of the pop() method that removes the item at a given position from a singly linked structure.
This function expects a position as a first argument, with
Precondition: 0 <= index < length(head) of structure
Raises: IndexError exception if this condition is not met.
It's second argument is the linked structure, which, of course, cannot be empty.
The function returns a tuple containing the modified linked structure and the item that was removed. An example call is (head, item) = pop(1, head).

To test your program run the main() method below in the testnode.py file:

def main():
    """Tests modifications."""
    head = None

    head = insert(0, "1", head)
    print("1:", end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    (head, item) = pop(0, head)
    print("1:", item, end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    # Add five nodes to the beginning of the linked structure
    for count in range(1, 6):
        head = Node(count, head)

    (head, item) = pop(0, head)
    print("5 4 3 2 1:", item, end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    (head, item) = pop(length(head) - 1, head)
    print("1 4 3 2:", item, end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    (head, item) = pop(1, head)
    print("3 4 2:", item, end = " ")
    printStructure(head)

    pop(4, head)

if __name__ == "__main__": main()

Your program's output should look like the following:

1: 1 
1: 1 
5 4 3 2 1: 5 4 3 2 1 
1 4 3 2: 1 4 3 2 
3 4 2: 3 4 2 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".solution/testnode.py", line 104, in <module>
    if __name__ == "__main__": main()
  File ".solution/testnode.py", line 99, in main
    pop(4, head)
  File ".solution/testnode.py", line 45, in pop
    raise IndexError("Index out of bounds")
IndexError: Index out of bounds
